# Some basic stuff for collecting and analysing data from the TIER scooters üõ¥

It stores the geopositions, battery level, state and some other information of every [TIER](https://tier.app) scooter inside Paderborn (the region can be [configured](https://github.com/myxor/TierScooterAnalysis/blob/master/config.example.ini#L2)) into a local SQLite database.
It currently provides a basic nodejs RESTful API and two HTML pages to visualize the stored data.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots so you can see how it looks right now.

### Heatmap of all geopositions

### Current positions of all vehicles and track of one vehicle

## RESTful API

The node RESTful API currenctly provides three endpoints to request the stored data:

### get list of vehicles

#### get list of all vehicles

    GET http://localhost:3000/vehicles
    
#### get single vehicle filtered by internal id
    
    GET http://localhost:3000/vehicles?vehicle_id=34
    
#### get single vehicle filtered by id from TIER

    GET http://localhost:3000/vehicles?id=9cd68586-a1e9-48f6-8eb5-a39a25f59769

### get current positions

#### get list of all current positions

    GET http://localhost:3000/current
    
#### get current position of single vehicle filtered by internal id

    GET http://localhost:3000/current?vehicle_id=34
    
#### get current position of single vehicle filtered by id from TIER

    GET http://localhost:3000/current?id=9cd68586-a1e9-48f6-8eb5-a39a25f59769


### get the log

    GET http://localhost:3000/log
    
#### get the log of single vehicle filtered by internal id

    GET http://localhost:3000/log?vehicle_id=34



## Pre-requisites üõ†
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* A modern browser

## Quick start üçï

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the following command from the root directory of the repo in your favourite terminal.

  ```npm install```

3. Start API with

  ```node api.js```

4. Copy config.example.ini to config.ini and adapt settings if you want

5. Run the data aggregator with

  ```python3 log.py```

6. Boom! Open index_current_positions.html or index_heatmap.html in your browser.



## Periodic aggregation of the data

You can run the logger on your server by crontab:

The following example will log vehicle information every minute:

  ```*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 ~/TierScooterAnalysis/log.py```

By default the script will log every position that is different from the last one logged for this vehicle or if the last logged position is atleast 30 minutes old.


## Technology stack
* Python3 for backend data aggregator
* Node for the RESTful API
* jQuery, CSS, HTML for the frontend
* SQLite for the database

## Help wanted

Any participation and help from others on this is very welcome.
