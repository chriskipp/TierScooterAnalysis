# TierScooterAnalysis

--> Work in progress.


It stores the geopositions, battery level, state and some other information of every [TIER](https://tier.app) scooter inside Paderborn (can be changed) into a sqlite3 database.
It currently provides a basic nodejs RESTful API and two HTML pages to see the stored data.

## Screenshots

### Heatmap of all geopositions

### Current positions of all vehicles and track of one vehicle

4. Copy config.example.ini to config.ini and adapt settings if you want

5. Run the data aggregator with

    python3 log.py

6. Boom! Open index_current_positions.html or index_heatmap.html in your browser.

## Periodic aggregation of the data

You can run the logger on your server by crontab:

The following example will log sensor values every minute:
